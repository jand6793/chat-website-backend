# Chat Website Backend - Open Source

## The Repository

This repository ("`chat-website-backend`") is where we develop the [Chat Website Backend](https://www.chatib.us/) product together with the community. 

---

This is a backend for a chat website based on fastapi and Python 3.11+.  

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **Google** and **Amazon** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> (previously known as Swagger) and <a href="https://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a>.

## Requirements

Python 3.11+

Chat Website Backend stands on the shoulders of giants:

* <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/" class="external-link" target="_blank">FastAPI</a> for the web parts.
* <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic</a> for the data parts.

## Installation

* Install the latest version of <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Python</a>
* Then install pipenv

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install pipenv

---> 100%
```

</div>

* Now you can install the requirements

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pipenv install --dev

---> 100%
```

</div>

## Configure it

Create a `.env` file from `.env.template` with your own values:
* To generate a secret key, you can use the following command:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python genSecretKey.py
```

</div>

## Run it

Run the server with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uvicorn src.app.api.server:app --reload

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [28720]
INFO:     Started server process [28722]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

</div>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>About the command <code>uvicorn src.app.api.server:app --reload</code>...</summary>

The command `uvicorn src.app.api.server:app` refers to:

* `src.app.api.server`: the file `server.py` (the Python "module").
* `app`: the object created inside of `server.py` with the line `app = get_application()`.
* `--reload`: make the server restart after code changes. Only do this for development.

### Interactive API docs

Now go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui" class="external-link" target="_blank">Swagger UI</a>):

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-01-swagger-ui-simple.png)

### Alternative API docs

And now, go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc</a>.

You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">ReDoc</a>):

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-02-redoc-simple.png)

## Example

### Create it

* Create a file `main.py` with:

```Python
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Or use <code>async def</code>...</summary>

If your code uses `async` / `await`, use `async def`:

```Python hl_lines="9  14"
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

**Note**:

If you don't know, check the _"In a hurry?"_ section about <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#in-a-hurry" target="_blank">`async` and `await` in the docs</a>.

</details>

## Example upgrade

Now modify the file `main.py` to receive a body from a `PUT` request.

Declare the body using standard Python types, thanks to Pydantic.

```Python hl_lines="4  9-12  25-27"
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: Union[bool, None] = None


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

The server should reload automatically (because you added `--reload` to the `uvicorn` command above).

### Interactive API docs upgrade

Now go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

* The interactive API documentation will be automatically updated, including the new body:

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-03-swagger-02.png)

* Click on the button "Try it out", it allows you to fill the parameters and directly interact with the API:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-04-swagger-03.png)

* Then click on the "Execute" button, the user interface will communicate with your API, send the parameters, get the results and show them on the screen:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-05-swagger-04.png)

### Alternative API docs upgrade

And now, go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc</a>.

* The alternative documentation will also reflect the new query parameter and body:

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-06-redoc-02.png)

### Recap

In summary, you declare **once** the types of parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.

You do that with standard modern Python types.

You don't have to learn a new syntax, the methods or classes of a specific library, etc.

Just standard **Python 3.7+**.

For example, for an `int`:

```Python
item_id: int
```

or for a more complex `Item` model:

```Python
item: Item
```

...and with that single declaration you get:

* Editor support, including:
    * Completion.
    * Type checks.
* Validation of data:
    * Automatic and clear errors when the data is invalid.
    * Validation even for deeply nested JSON objects.
* <abbr title="also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling">Conversion</abbr> of input data: coming from the network to Python data and types. Reading from:
    * JSON.
    * Path parameters.
    * Query parameters.
    * Cookies.
    * Headers.
    * Forms.
    * Files.
* <abbr title="also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling">Conversion</abbr> of output data: converting from Python data and types to network data (as JSON):
    * Convert Python types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, etc).
    * `datetime` objects.
    * `UUID` objects.
    * Database models.
    * ...and many more.
* Automatic interactive API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces:
    * Swagger UI.
    * ReDoc.

---

Coming back to the previous code example, **FastAPI** will:

* Validate that there is an `item_id` in the path for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
* Validate that the `item_id` is of type `int` for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
    * If it is not, the client will see a useful, clear error.
* Check if there is an optional query parameter named `q` (as in `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery`) for `GET` requests.
    * As the `q` parameter is declared with `= None`, it is optional.
    * Without the `None` it would be required (as is the body in the case with `PUT`).
* For `PUT` requests to `/items/{item_id}`, Read the body as JSON:
    * Check that it has a required attribute `name` that should be a `str`.
    * Check that it has a required attribute `price` that has to be a `float`.
    * Check that it has an optional attribute `is_offer`, that should be a `bool`, if present.
    * All this would also work for deeply nested JSON objects.
* Convert from and to JSON automatically.
* Document everything with OpenAPI, that can be used by:
    * Interactive documentation systems.
    * Automatic client code generation systems, for many languages.
* Provide 2 interactive documentation web interfaces directly.

We just scratched the surface, but you already get the idea of how it all works.

Try changing the line with:

```Python
    return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

...from:

```Python
        ... "item_name": item.name ...
```

...to:

```Python
        ... "item_price": item.price ...
```

...and see how your editor will auto-complete the attributes and know their types:

For a more complete example including more features, see the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/">Tutorial - User Guide</a>.

**Spoiler alert**: the tutorial - user guide includes:

* Declaration of **parameters** from other different places as: **headers**, **cookies**, **form fields** and **files**.
* How to set **validation constraints** as `maximum_length` or `regex`.
* A very powerful and easy to use **<abbr title="also known as components, resources, providers, services, injectables">Dependency Injection</abbr>** system.
* Security and authentication, including support for **OAuth2** with **JWT tokens** and **HTTP Basic** auth.
* More advanced (but equally easy) techniques for declaring **deeply nested JSON models** (thanks to Pydantic).
* **GraphQL** integration with <a href="https://strawberry.rocks" class="external-link" target="_blank">Strawberry</a> and other libraries.
* Many extra features (thanks to Starlette) as:
    * **WebSockets**
    * extremely easy tests based on HTTPX and `pytest`
    * **CORS**
    * **Cookie Sessions**
    * ...and more.
